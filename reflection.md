    This assignment kicked my ass.
    
    As my first late assignment since high school, and one that I had to push back multiple times because I kept underestimating how big it would get, I struggled with this one. In the end, my only really major issue was a lack of understanding on how class objects worked. The fundamental component was simply that I didn't quite grasp the existence of object indexes and how linking to the index is how to manipulate and move around java objects. Now that I understand that, hopefully future assignments will go much more smoothly.
    
    At the beginning I found myself looking up every concept and struggling through every line of code, even once I had overcome my major conceptual hurdle, but five days and over twelve hours of work later I found myself quickly and efficiently saling through the Train.java file. When I finished putting together all of the commands on that file, I set up the main method and ran it, encountered one error, fixed it, and on my second try the entire document ran smoothly. That's how much of a change I experiences from Wednesday through to Sunday.
    
    Encapsulation, hilariously enough, was something that I completely understood already. The whole difficulty of this assignment was OOP, which I should have learned in previous assignments if I wasn't struggling to udnerstand the language I was coding in. I knew Encapsulation from my year of WebDev and it was a crucial tool there for working across programming languages without bloat and protecting sensitive information in the backend to prevent hackers from getting access to what they shouldn't. I am confident I will use encapsulation regularly, if not for cybersecurity, then certainly to help organize my code and make it easier to understand. One thing that was nice about doing encapsulation in java is that I didn't have to link a file path for everything like I did in HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. It was a breath of fresh air.

    I think i've taken enough of this class to finally answer this question properly. What worked? Taking time. By extending my deadline I was able to properly dig into this assignment. I could have done this so easily if I skipped OOP and did it my own way, but by sticking to the assignment description, reading and re-reading the readme and rubric, and pushing my duedate up over and over, I was able to pack three assignments worth of learning into one and hopefully get a far better grade out of it too. What didn't work? Procrastinating the assignment to Monday, only doing the pseudocode, and then procrastinating the rest to Wednesday. That has to stop. I don't have a choice with the next assignment, since i'm writing this at 11:35 on Sunday having spent my entire weekend working on this assignment, but for the future I will change this way of going about it.
